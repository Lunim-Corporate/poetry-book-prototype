                  <p><strong>Napier Marten has had deep connection with the natural world since boyhood. Born and raised in Cranborne Chase, he also has a lifetime affinity with the Moray Firth where he has spent much of his life and early education. An inveterate traveller, he is drawn to wild and less trodden parts of the globe.</strong></p>
                  <p>From an early age he saw there is a wisdom beyond rational human constructs of conditioned experience, evolved through his upbringing on his family’s estate in South West England. This established his lifelong interest in ecology, the environment and life’s cycles, providing the basis for his poetry, which frequently alludes to the importance of reconnection to Nature.</p>
                  <p>Napier has had a varied career, including rural management, arborist, hedge-layer, actor, helicopter pilot, and aviation and arboriculture consultancy. He is an active cranio-sacral practitioner and has a small farm near Shaftesbury dedicated to local flora and fauna. Taplash Meditations consists of three parts: This Rusty Nail Dawn, poems written in the USA, Vietnam, Eire and England; Rage And Chocolate, poems written in Scotland and Let Us Drink Hibiscus, poems written Mexico.</p>
                  <p>All the poems have been written since 2018 and are the first volume Napier has published.</p>
