                  presses. We are proud to be a Welsh-based, international contest open to all indie poets globally.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                  Even though more and more people enjoy and participate in creative writing, it is becoming
                  increasingly difficult to become traditionally published, especially in poetry. Most of the top book
                  prizes and competitions do not allow self-published authors to enter. If they are allowed, then many
                  are extremely expensive, leaving truly independent publishers, self-publishers and indie authors
                  struggling to find the recognition they deserve. Instead of asking for huge sums of money from those
                  shortlisted, we charge an entry fee for each entry.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After twenty years of finding and promoting outstanding poets through the International Welsh Poetry
                  Competition, we now aim to bring further recognition to those writers who have produced a book-length
                  collection of their work and hope to heighten a poet’s profile by offering this new award.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="aboutCol">
                <p>
                  In our first few years, we have already had poets from Australia, Canada, Cyprus, England, France,
                  Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Mauritius, Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, South
                  Africa, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, USA &amp; Wales! The Maya Poetry Book Awards are therefore a truly
                  international competition, accessible to all (through the English language).
                </p>

                <h3>Funding</h3>
                <p>
                  The awards are funded purely by the organisers &amp; entrants - we receive no grants, bursaries or
                  funding from the Arts Council of Wales, Literature Wales, the Welsh Books Council or any other
                  external agencies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We must say a big thank you to Michael Schmidt OBE, FRSL, founder of Carcanet Press and editor of PN
                  Review, who was very supportive when we first set up this competition.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We have a pool of experienced judges and readers to call upon, including award-winning poets and well-respected authors. We do not use filter judges at the moment, but may have to incorporate this at a later date, depending on how many entries we receive.

                <p>
                  The cost of each book entered is just £40. We are based in the United Kingdom and accept payments by card in all currencies. Discounts are available if sending more than one book. Then the cost is £35 per book, e.g. two books will be £70, three books will be £105 and so on.

                <summary>Who can enter?</summary>
                <p>
                  Only individual poets can enter. We can't accept anthologies at the moment. We will, however, "bend the rules" for co-authored books - just two writers, as we have had a few requests for this to be allowed.

              <details class="faq__item">
                <summary>What is meant by an independent/small publisher?</summary>
                <p>
                  We want to give well-deserved recognition to self-published authors and smaller presses. Big publishing houses probably don't need us to provide them with recognition. They can afford to pay the large entry fees (often several thousand pounds) to enter prestigious awards, but for most smaller presses in the world, having one of their poets win a prize such as ours will be a refreshing change. Only self-published poetry books and those published by small, truly independent presses are eligible to enter. Publishers that get huge grants from arts councils, universities, local government, books councils, arts quangos and other sponsorships are NOT considered independent (even though some like to say they are) so their books are not eligible.

              <details class="faq__item">
                <summary>Can publishers/authors send more than one poetry book?</summary>
                <p>
                  Yes. Publishers and authors can enter several books if they wish, as long as each book is accompanied by an entry fee.
                </p>
              </details>
              <details class="faq__item">
                <summary>Why is the entry fee so reasonable?</summary>
                <p>
                  Most competitions will charge an entry fee unless they have millions of pounds to spend because they are a taxpayer-funded arts quango. Other awards may get financial backing or sponsorship from a major company or business. Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury, and like many contests, we are completely self-funded, and for the awards to function, we must charge an entry fee. We pay our costs out of our own pocket and/or from entry fees. Our costs are administrative, prize money, web design and maintenance, domain name and hosting, payment to our readers/judges, extensive marketing and advertising, not to mention our time. Having said that, to encourage small presses and individual self-publishers to enter, we still want to keep our fees as low as possible and not outprice entrants. A good example of how high fees can discriminate against smaller, independent writers would be WH Smiths, who request £25,000 for a book that is selected by the "Richard and Judy" book club (correct figures as of 2010). Another example is the Costa Book Awards, which used to require publishers to pay a £5,000 fee if a book is shortlisted (correct figures as of 2019). In the UK, it is common to charge anything from £5 to £20 to enter a single poem into a contest, so our entry fee is very low indeed, especially when comparing on a cost per poem basis. Many indie book awards charge £70 to £100 per book, so once again, we are starting as low as we possibly can. We increased the prize money dramatically (for 2026) but have kept the entry fee low. We will probably have to increase the fee next year though.

                  When mailing in copies of your books, please be sure to include the correct postage on the package. Incorrect postage could result in your package being returned to you and possibly in you missing the deadline. Also, please avoid sending book(s) shipments requesting a signature. Requesting signatures for proof of delivery can cause a delay in receiving and processing your books.
